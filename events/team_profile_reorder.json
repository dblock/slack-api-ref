  "long_desc": "The team_profile_reorder event is sent to all connections for a workspace when Workspace Admin reorders the field definitions in the profile. The payload includes only the id and the ordering for each field definition that is reordered. Where appropriate, clients should update to reflect new changes immediately. When an event occurs, we will send an HTTP POST request to your Request URL. The outer payload is uniform across all Events API methods, and contains fields like team_id and event. Learn more",
