  "long_desc": "This event is no longer served. File comments have been phased out in favor of regular messages and threadsâ€”read our changelog entry for more information. The file_comment_deleted event is sent when a file comment is deleted. It is sent to all connected clients for users who can see the file. Clients can use this notification to update comments in real-time for open files. The file property includes the file ID, as well as a top-level file_id. To obtain additional information about the file, use the files.info API method. Unlike file_comment_added and file_comment_edited the comment property only contains the ID of the deleted comment, not the full comment object.",
